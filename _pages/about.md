I have been working on the development of statistical methods and platforms for cancer genome sequencing data analysis.
Currently, my specific goals include:
- Create an analysis platform to extract the maximum amount of information from cancer genome sequencing data,
- Build an infrastructure that can autonomously acquire information from increasing accumulating omics data,
- Contribute to cancer genomic medicine.

Please see the projects section for a more detailed description.
If you are interested in our research and would like to work together, feel free to contact me via [e-mail](mailto:yuishira@ncc.go.jp)!.
