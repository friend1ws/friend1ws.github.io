I have been working on developing statistical methods and platforms for cancer genome sequencing data analysis.
Currently, my specific goals includes:
- Create analysis platform to extract maximum amount of information from cancer genome sequencing data
- Build an infrastructure that can autonomously acquire information from increasing accumulating omics data
- Contribute to cancer genome medicine

Please find more detailed description in the projects section.
If you have interest in our research and would like to work together, feel free to reach out to me by [e-mail](mailto:yuishira@ncc.go.jp)!.
